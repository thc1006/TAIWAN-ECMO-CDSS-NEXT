if np.mean([p.communication_score for p in recent_performance]) < 75:
    weak_areas.append("communication")
if np.mean([p.decision_making_score for p in recent_performance]) < 75:
    weak_areas.append("decision_making")
```

### 4.4 Scenario Recommendation Logic (Lines 485-502)

**Prioritization by Weakness:**
```python
# Technical weakness → scenarios with "technique" in title
if "technical" in weak_areas and "technique" in scenario.title.lower():
    recommended_scenarios.append(scenario.scenario_id)

# Communication weakness → scenarios with "team" in key skills
elif "communication" in weak_areas and "team" in ' '.join(scenario.key_skills).lower():
    recommended_scenarios.append(scenario.scenario_id)

# Decision-making weakness → scenarios with "emergency" in title
elif "decision_making" in weak_areas and "emergency" in scenario.title.lower():
    recommended_scenarios.append(scenario.scenario_id)
```

**Fallback (No Specific Weaknesses):**
```python
if not recommended_scenarios:
    recommended_scenarios = [s.scenario_id for s in available_scenarios[:3]]
```

**Recommendation Limit:** Maximum 5 scenarios returned
